## What is this Project?

This is my portfolio site. Its purpose is to give an introduction to the projects I'm working on, and the value I can bring to your team. 

## How'd You Build It?

This site is a single-view webpage built on top of a Ruby/Sinatra backend. It employs compiled SCSS and a little Javascript for style.

## Nice Code. Can I View an Actual Web Page? 

Why, yes you can. <a href="https://micah-bales-portfolio.herokuapp.com/">Just click here.</a>
